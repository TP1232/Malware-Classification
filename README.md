# Malware-Classification

- The initial goal of this project is to predict a Windows machineâ€™s probability of getting infected by various classes of malware, considering unique properties of respective machine. Hence, the data required for malware prediction can be any information about the state of a computer which is hit by a malware attack. As there are several classes of malware attacks, machines may react differently in response when attacked. Therefore, it is recommended to collect a huge and varied quantity of data about computers that are undergone through attacks. Most of the data comes from the system behavior of the machine and the type of the machine.

- Objective: Analyze the different methods and compare their solutions in order to provide the pros and cons of different methods and approaches that were used to tackle this problem and derive a conclusion on which method is more effective for predicting the malwares effectively into their respective families based on multiple evaluation metrics.
