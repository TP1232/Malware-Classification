# Malware Classification On Microsoft Malware Dataset

- The initial goal of this project is to predict a Windows machine’s probability of getting infected by various classes of malware, considering unique properties of respective machine. Hence, the data required for malware prediction can be any information about the state of a computer which is hit by a malware attack. As there are several classes of malware attacks, machines may react differently in response when attacked. Therefore, it is recommended to collect a huge and varied quantity of data about computers that are undergone through attacks. Most of the data comes from the system behavior of the machine and the type of the machine.

- Objective: Analyze the different methods and compare their solutions in order to provide the pros and cons of different methods and approaches that were used to tackle this problem and derive a conclusion on which method is more effective for predicting the malwares effectively into their respective families based on multiple evaluation metrics.

### Abstract

Perform a Classification on Kaggle’s Microsoft Malware Classification dataset
- Accomplished more than 90% accuracy after trying logistic regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, SVM.
- Decision Tree perform very well in this dataset, So I tried Tuning it with different hyper parameters in Decision Tree
which increased the accuracy to more than 95%.
- Also applied feature selection with tuned Decision Tree model for 10/25/50/75/100 features. Where 50 best features
surpass the 98% accuracy in that dataset.
